# TakeItOrLeaveIt
Webpage for giving away house items to friends
Well here we were - me and Rosh after waiting for 9 months to hear something good from the Canadian government and finally we got our permanent residency approved and passports stamped - yayyyyy.
So next logical step - packup and leave - easy said ofcourse, we have been in California for 6 years which means we ofcourse have tons of stuff to get rid of and ofcourse tons of friends who would want to take it from us but who has the time and patience to go through an open house/garage sale kind of event and take what you want. So I decided to make a simple webpage (didnt wanna go through the hassle of making an app and all that) - which will give my friends an idea of things I want to get rid of and let me know if they want it. I have to take pictures of these stuff anyway to sell it on offer-up or ebay then why not do it a bit differently - who knows this might turn into a money making full fleged app in the future.
Currently I am only using react-native for the web page since everyone prefers to look at websites on their phone so I want something that would work across platforms.
Another reason of putting it as a web-page is that I don't intend to publish it to the stores unless it is entirely developed and pretty looking but I dont have that much time so any help on this is very much welcome, for now I just wanted a way to share this with my friends.
